	# My favourite series right now:
 **Arcane**
 *Arcane is a series made by Riot Games, the creator of league of Legends, which is also my most played game.*
 **Reasons Why I love Arcane**
1. First of all, Arcane is a story about a champion from league of legends, which is my favourite game, so watching the characters i play and how their story went adds more depth and it's really cool how they interact with other champions and how they show their abilities realistically compared to the game
2. Although game adaptations have bad reputations, arcane is very different, from a unique artstyle, great music and really good story telling, you can really see how much thought they planned out for this.
3. The animation aand fight scenes are amazing! together with the great music taste? arcane truly is a masterpiece
4. One of the best things about arcane is the world building, League of Legends as a game can be dreadful, but the lore behind the characters are amazing. Arcane is responsible on helping people visualize the world of runeterra and the characters and they are doing amazing. Although we are only focusing on piltover and zaun as of now, They have been teasing other regions and characters and concepts from the game, and as a player it is really hype to see other characters especially my mains be introduced.
5. Although being a league of legends player has a merit when watching arcane, you really don't have to be to enjoy it. Riot games makes it so that even fresh watchers can enjoy the show because of how rich their story telling is.
